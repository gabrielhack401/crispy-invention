Static site for Banco Social Pi (BSPI) token dashboard.

## Deployment

This project is a simple static HTML/CSS/JS site. To deploy on Vercel:

1. Commit and push the repository to GitHub.
2. Create a new project on Vercel and import the GitHub repo.
3. Vercel will automatically detect the `vercel.json` config and deploy the static site.

No build step is required; assets are served from the root directory.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main page
- `css/style.css` – stylesheet
- `js/app.js` – JavaScript logic
- `vercel.json` – Vercel configuration

Feel free to modify and push updates; Vercel will redeploy on each push.
